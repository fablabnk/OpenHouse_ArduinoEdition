This event is for new students of 42 Berlin to get to the know the FabLab and especially the 'clean lab'.

# The goal

Build an Arduino project together which involves electronics, code and some fabrication!

And learn about:
- the different types of Arduino, components and sensors we have the lab and how to use them
- how to upload code to an Arduino using the Arduino IDE
- how to simulate Arduino-based circuits and code using Tinkercad
- how to use a breadboard
- ...and much more!
