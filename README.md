		- 2 x SG90s
- Relevant books
- What we have and where to find it
	- Arduino's: Uno / Uno Wifi Uno Clones / Nano / MKR
		- Today we will only use the Uno
	- Breadboards
	- Sensors, LEDs, kits etc
- Tinkercad

- Setting up the Arduino IDE
	- Board basics:
		- Tools -> Board, Tool -> Port
		- 
	- Upload the blink example
- Breadboarding basics

# Starter Topics (3:30-4:15)

- sign up for a Tinkercad account
- check out one of the following projects to get started
- each project has contains a Tinkercad "Preview" - a simulation of the project
- build first, then
